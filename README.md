## My attempt for Coding Allstars Trial Test, Python Web Scraper And Translater

- href_collector.py grabs href links in html file of a given url, concatenates relative urls with absolute url, writes down all the links in a txt file line by line.

- html_leech.py reads the txt file mentioned above, writes down html content regarding subpages within the main url.

- linkos.txt contains the scraped urls from given url, at this case, https://www.classcentral.com/
